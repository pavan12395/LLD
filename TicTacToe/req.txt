Design Patterns and Principles Learnt :-


1) SRP :- A class or method should deal with only one functionality

2) OCP :- Open for new changes / Closed for modifications (RuleEngine)

3) LSP :- All subclasses should implement the exact methods provided by Interface or Abstract classes

4) ISP :- Instead of having a strong-coupling of getCells method from TicTacToeBoard , I can create a board
          interface which will definitely have String[][] getCells() method

5) DIP :- Achieving Higher level of Abstraction.


Design Patterns :-

1) ProtoType pattern
2) Chain Responsibility pattern , Singleton Pattern
3) Factory pattern , Strategy pattern ,state pattern
4) Proxy design pattern :- Dont create an Object unless required.
